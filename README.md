# Intro
SportMonks API wrapper for C#/.NET

This API implementation covers 95% of endpoints and responses provided by SportMonks API v3.
You can easily extend it by deriving from BaseApiClient class or by extending existing XyzApiClient classes.

# Getting started
- Obtain API token from [SportMonks API](https://my.sportmonks.com/api/tokens) dashboard
- Set it inside BaseApiClient.cs class for `apiKey` field (or put inside token.txt into root folder of the project)
- Test API client classes via .Executable project (console app)
